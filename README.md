# LP_Py_Rep
Since the seminal work of Òscar Jordà (2005), Local Projections (LP) has been widely used in economics research. The idea is simple and elegant. But due to the econonics community programming habit, most of the coding are done in Stata and Matlab.
The core idea of LP is to run an iteration of regression series. Python as a language is very good at this, maybe better & elegant than Stata and Matlab.

This repository aims to provide Python version LP replication code in Pro. Jordà's website: https://sites.google.com/site/oscarjorda/home/local-projections.

Future work may expand to Baysian LP etc.

Note:
- The replication file name are one to one unless it is pointed out seperately. For example, lp_example.py is the morror file to lp_example.do

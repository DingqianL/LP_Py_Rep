# LP_Py_Rep
Since the seminal work of Òscar Jordà (2005), Local Projections (LP) has been widely used in economics research. The idea is simple and elegant. But due to the econonics community programming habit, most of the coding are done in Stata and Matlab.

This repository aims to provide Python version LP replication code in Pro. Jordà's website: https://sites.google.com/site/oscarjorda/home/local-projections.

Future work may expand to Baysian LP etc.
